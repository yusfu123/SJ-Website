				<h1>	Racial Injustice: </h1>
				<img src="images/blm.jpg" alt="black lives matter sign" height="160" width="180">
				<p> Although racial injustice has received a great deal of attention and greatly decreased, it is apparent that it is still present today. The United States have yet to escape from their troubled past full of racism and discrimination. The racism, slavery, and segregation that Black Americans experienced did not stop at the Civil Rights Movement, the ripple effects of it can be seen today. They are one of the most disadvantaged demographics in America. They face income inequality like no other race, and they are 3.5 times more likely to be killed by police than White Americans. Black Americans also struggle to receive proper healthcare due to low income. </p>
				<h1> Gender Injustice:</h1>
				<p> According to the American Association of University Women, women make 82% of what a man would make doing the exact same job.  
					Globally, women are often treated as second-class citizens. In many countries, women are not given educations, because men are seen as the priority. 
					1 in 3 women have experienced sexual violence with or without an intimate partner. </p>
				<h1>Climate injustice: </h1>
				<img src="images/climate.jpg" alt="black lives matter sign" height="160" width="180">
				<p> Global warming has exponentially increased since the dawn of the 21st century. The consequences include extreme weather events, worse natural disasters, rise in sea level, destroyed ecosystems, poor air quality, lessening access to food and water, a rise in temperature, and more. The countries who are the root causes of climate change (America, China) are not going to face the worst of the consequences. Instead, poor and vulnerable countries will suffer the most.

				<h1> LGBTQ+ Injustice:</h1>
				<p> Individuals in the LGBTQ+ community face numerous forms of oppression. Transgender people often face the most discrimination and harassment in the community, with 90% of them experiencing it on the job. Roughly 41% of respondents in a survey by the GLAAD, report attempting suicide. </p>
				<h1>Disability Injustice: </h1>
				<img src="images/handicap.jpg" alt="handicap parking symbol" height="170" width="200">
				<p> People with disabilities often face direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, and harassment inside and outside of the workplace. Direct discrimination being inferior treatment of somebody because of their disability. Indirect discrimination is when a system is built in a way that impacts disabled people negatively. Harassment is the antagonization or bullying of disabled people. </p>
				<h1>Age Injustice: </h1>
				<p> Ageism occurs when elderly people are denied opportunity because they are seen as incapable, feeble, and a burden. Elderly people are often forced to retire because they are overlooked in the work force, leaving them with no way to secure income.  </p>
