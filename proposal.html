		<h1> Information On Social Justice Issues</h1>
		<p> 
		For my website, I originally wanted to create a fitness and habit tracker,
		however we are limited in scope because our class will not cover that material.. 
		So I decided that i wanted to create a website that aims to inform people about social injustice
		and show people how they can help combat social injustice of various kinds.
		Anyone could view my website and gain something, but the target audience is
		people who are interested in learning about social justice. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Some of the characteristics i may add in order to cater towards the audience include an easy to
		navigate homepage, relevant pictures, links to
		more interactive sites, different pages that list information about the different types of social 
		injustice, different pages for different groups that face social injustice (gender, race, etc),
		and webpages that give the target audience a way to take action (donations). This site will 
		cater to said audience because they will be able to identify with the information listed because
		everyone has experienced, seen, or can empathize with social justice issues.
		</P>
		<p>
		For this website, I would like to begin with an HTML skeleton of what I would like 
		my website to be. Just an overall structure with webpages and space for pictures so that it
		will be easier for me later on. After that would be the researching/writing process, where I will
		research types of social justice, who they occur to, and how people can help, which 
		will likely be the most time consuming step. I would also like to find other websites that my target audience
		may find useful. Then I would search for free to use and relevant pictures.
		And lastly, I would add the research and pictures into the HTML file, and make the necessary
		adjustments. As for a literal timeline, I do not have anything specific in mind, but I will 
		make deadlines for myself if there are no deadlines for it in the class. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As previously stated, I will be researching the internet and databases for content 
		to use in the website. That means all content will be not be created by me, but paraphrased from different sources
		and combined into one cohesive project. Graphic/media content will be the same, I will be acquiring it not creating it.
		This site will be updated with new information annually (breaking news related to social justice can be updated on the spot)
		, and I will be the one to do so.
