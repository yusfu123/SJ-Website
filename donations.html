						<h1>INCOME INEQUALITY:</h1>
					<p>inequality.org is run by the Institute for Policy Studies, which works to implement public policy that combats inequality at a local, state, and global scale. They have a variety of different initiatives. Here are some of the standout ones: </p>
					<dl>
					  <dt> 1-	The Charitable Giving Reform: This project works to overhaul the rules of philanthropy that have gradually made charity more focused on large donations from a small quantity of high-class donors than donations from low- and middle-class donors. This trend has given only a small group of people, the extremely wealthy, the power to fix the problems they want to solve. The issue with this is that it forces organizations to cater efforts towards what wealthy donors want. This project works to diversify the donor base, protect institutions from private powers, and prevent future abuses.</dt>
					 
					  <dt> 2-	Closing the Wage Gap: The issue of the wage gap has gotten marginally worse over the past few decades. The IPS is working to close the gap between the salary of an average worker and a CEO with public policy at a state and local level. </dt>
					 
					  <dt> 3-	 Racial Economic Divide: This project aims to address income inequality in regard to race and class through public policy and research reports. </dt>
					
					  <dt> 4-	Black Worker Initiative: This initiative continues and supports the historic civil rights movement by expanding opportunities for black workers, who have been hit harder than anyone else when it comes to inequality. </dt>
