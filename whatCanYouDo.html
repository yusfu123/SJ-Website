				<p> In the 21st Century, the world is at its peak of globalization, so humanity is more connected than it has ever been. Which has led to the different social injustices happening around the world being shared on the internet for people to witness. This has caused people to stand against these injustices, and push for global social justice more than ever before. </p>
				<h1>1-	Promotion through social media: </h1>

				<p>Spreading the word about different social injustices occurring globally/locally is great for inspiring awareness in other individuals. Spreading donation links is effective in helping causes that you care about. And sharing your volunteer efforts can inspire others to take action as well.   </p>
				<h1>2-	Educate yourself and those around you:  </h1>
				<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the issues occurring around you locally and globally is important to solving them, and it will help you figure out which causes resonate with you the most.  </p>
				<h1>3-	Volunteer in your community: </h1>

				<p>It is one thing to say that you advocate for change and that you dislike social injustice. It is an entirely different thing to go out and make that change yourself. Volunteering is the best way to make a difference in your community, and it allows you to improve causes that you are particularly concerned about. It is a great way to build strength in community, improve bad situations, and meet new like-minded individuals. </p>
				<h1>4-	Donate:</h1>
				<p>This is one of the best ways to support people facing social injustice. There is only so much one individual can do. By donating to non-profit organizations, you are giving able professionals the means to make a difference. </p>
